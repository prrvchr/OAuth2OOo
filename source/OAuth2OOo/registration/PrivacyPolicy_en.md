## Use of your personal data:

To work `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension` need to keep data locally on the `Computer`.

The location of this data is in the `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension` application directory, respectively.

The deletion of data collected by `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension`, is guaranteed, by the `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension` application uninstall, respectively.

Use of the `Supplier` services through `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension`, may submit you to the Data Protection Policy of `Supplier`. It is the responsibility of the `User` to take knowledge of these Policy from the `Supplier` website.

`Supplier` is solely responsible for the use of the data it collects as described in its Policy.

## Expiry of collected data:

Updating the data collected locally is done each time `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension` is used.

**The deletion of data collected locally, is possible by uninstalling** `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension` **respectively**.

It is the responsibility of the `User` to uninstall `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension` in order to delete the collected data.

Use of the `Supplier` services via `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension` may subject you to the data protection Policy of `Supplier`. It is the responsibility of the `User` to review this Policy from the `Supplier` website.
