**Ce [document][2] en fran√ßais.**

**Use of this software also subjects you to our [Terms Of Use][3].**

Regarding installation, configuration and use, please consult the **[documentation][4]**.

## Introduction:

The privacy of OAuth2OOo software user data is very important to us and we are committed to protecting it.

This policy explains what we do with your personal information.

For simplicity, in the rest of this document, will be named:
- `OAuth2OOo`: the OAuth2OOo software in its entirety.
- `User`: the user of the `OAuth2OOo` software.
- `Extension`: all extensions installed under LibreOffice and/or OpenOffice and using `OAuth2OOo` software services.
- `Supplier`: the internet service provider delivering the OAuth2 tokens to `OAuth2OOo` and/or internet services to `Extension`.

This policy, in addition to `OAuth2OOo`, also applies to all `Extension` that use `OAuth2OOo` software services.

Although **OAuth2OOo does not share or transfer any data to any other application**, if you are using `OAuth2OOo` with a Google account, then `OAuth2OOo` adhere to [Google API Services User Data Policy][5], including the Limited Use requirements.

## Contact:

In any case, it is possible to contact the person responsible for data processing at:

## Use of your personal data:

To work `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension` need to keep data locally.

The location of this data is in the `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension` application directory, respectively.

`OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension` **does not collect any data on external servers in any way.**

The deletion of data collected by `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension`, is guaranteed, by the `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension` application uninstall, respectively.

Use of the `Supplier` services through `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension`, may submit you to the Data Protection Policy of `Supplier`. It is the responsibility of the `User` to take knowledge of these Policy from the `Supplier` website.

`Supplier` is solely responsible for the use of the data it collects as described in its Policy.

## Security of your personal information:

Since the data collected by `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension` is located on the user's computer, only the `User` is responsible for the security of the data collected.

Use of the `Supplier` services via `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension` may subject you to the data protection Policy of `Supplier`. It is the responsibility of the `User` to review this Policy from the `Supplier` website.

`Supplier` is solely responsible for the security of the data it collects as described in its Policy.

## Expiration of collected data:

Updating the data collected locally is done each time `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension` is used.

**The deletion of data collected locally, is possible by the** `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension` **uninstall.**

It is the responsibility of the `User` to uninstall `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension` in order to delete the collected data.

Use of the `Supplier` services via `OAuth2OOo` and/or `Extension` may subject you to the data protection Policy of `Supplier`. It is the responsibility of the `User` to review this Policy from the `Supplier` website.

`Supplier` is solely responsible for the expiration of the data it collects as described in its Policy.
